# Snake But Bad (feat. Jake the Snake)

### Ground Rules
* Jake the Snake is on a mission to eat all of the apples.<br>
* Jake's mouth is always open on the off chance it eats an apple. This also leads to Jake periodically stabbing himself. Don't make Jake stab himself.<br>
* Jake's head is also very sensitive to walls. Don't hit Jake's head into a wall.
